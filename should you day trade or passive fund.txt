2017 Berkly Study on the Day Traders and rationallity. 

From the abstract:

"we document that the aggregate
performance of day traders is negative, that the vast majority of day traders are
unprofitable, and many persist despite an extensive experience of losses"


"The majority of day traders quit relatively
quickly (more that 75% of all day traders quit within two years), " (1)


"Using Finnish
data, Seru, Shumway, and Stoffman (2010) document investors not only learn about their
ability by trading, but also get better with experience. Linnainmaa (2010) calibrates a
structural model in which investors rationally learn about their ability through trading
using trading records of active individual Finnish investors. " (1)

"Therefore risk-averse or
risk-neutral potential speculators with no special prior knowledge of their abilities should
only “trade to learn” if aggregate speculator profits are positive. In fact, using complete
data for the Taiwan market, the aggregate performance of day traders net of fees is
negative in each of the 15 years that we study. A profit-maximizing risk-averse (or riskneutral) Bayesian investor would not enter a market if her expected lifetime profits were
negative." (2)


"The one
exception to this generalization being Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean (2010) who identify a
small subset of day traders (less than 1% of the day trading population) predictably earn
profits." (6)


"In this section,
we argue that rational learning does not explain behavior of the large population of
speculative investors for three reasons: aggregate performance is negative, experienced
speculators lose money, and unprofitable speculators persist."(12)
